This is my first Session... and last one? So ive been thinking about this idea alot, and thought about how this could work. I originally just wanted to make a reaction game but as that would be too boring I decided to make this one. I made the schematic but I wasnt sure about how to wire the switches, even though I worked with them before. I at the beginning wired all the switches in one row which was really du*b and I noticed when everything was wired. But I fixed it.

As you see there I also included the leds, even though they arent on the pcb as I am going to be using led strips (neopixel led strips) and it would make sense to be on the pcb as I want them ontop of the case.

Time it took to do this: 4 hours
