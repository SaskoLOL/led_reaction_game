This is my first Session... and last one? So ive been thinking about this idea alot, and thought about how this could work. I originally just wanted to make a reaction game but as that would be too boring I decided to make this one. I made the schematic but I wasnt sure about how to wire the switches, even though I worked with them before. I at the beginning wired all the switches in one row which was really du*b and I noticed when everything was wired. But I fixed it.

As you see there I also included the leds, even though they arent on the pcb as I am going to be using led strips (neopixel led strips) and it would make sense to be on the pcb as I want them ontop of the case.

# Second part of this project:
I pretty much made the whole case (I think it looks pretty ok based on my fusion 360 skills). The only real problem this taking so long. Because after my first try I made a big mistake, except making an outer rectangle that is 8mm longer on each side, that would serve as the shell, I just made the original one 8mm shorter!? Yea I couldnt believe it myself. Apart from that it was ok until I got to the top case, as placing the buttons and making the holes was pretty hard because I couldnt use a preset from keybpuard editor, as my board was a square and I needed excact as much space between the walls and the switches. After I got that done my extrusion tool was kinda wacky and even though I would extrude to the bottom it wouldnt cut the case, and when I went to the top it would just build something and not cut the case, so making the holes for the screws was pretty hard. Then I just put everything together and it was done.
